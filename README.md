# refresh-rate-setter
(THIS PROGRAM WAS MADE BY USING CHATGPT)

This is a simple program to set the refresh rate of the display of a Windows 11 laptop depending on it's charging status. 

##This program only works for laptops which support 60 Hz and 240 Hz refresh rates. When the laptop is plugged in, the refresh rate is set to 240 Hz and when it is unplugged, the refresh rate reduces to 60 Hz.

** THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOUR LAPTOP DISPLAY SUPPORTS 60 HZ AND 240 HZ AS MULTIPLE REFRESH RATES. **

#My Modifications 
Modified some text in the dropdown menu when opening the app from the systray, and modified the program so that it starts minimized by default.

#Starting the program at system StartUp
1. Make a shortcut of the ".bat" file.
2. Press Win + R to open the Run window.
3. Type "shell:startup" to open the startup folder.
4. Copy the shortcut into this folder.
5. Now you can freely enable or disable it to start whenever the laptop starts up through the task manager!
